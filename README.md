# PORTFOLIO

## Description
This Project is for my portfolio and this is an example of a react application, which can run and can use react to store and curate information. I decided to build this as I want react experience in my background. This fulfills the need in my portfolio to create and produce new and exciting applications in the future. I had the most trouble with useState and could not get it to work in my application.
